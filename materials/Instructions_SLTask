Phase 1:

You will now be performing a spatial learning task. In this phase, you will be trying to remember the locations of pictures of people, places, and things. There will be pauses throughout for you to rest. Please take as much time as you need during these pauses. 

First, you will see the locations of each picture once. Please try your best to remember the location of each picture. After you see the locations once, you will be tested on each location until you get it correct. I will be on the other side of this wall observing throughout and will inform you when you will be tested on the locations of the pictures. 

Until then, please keep the mouse still and simply watch the screen while trying to memorize the picture locations. Please click on the mouse to continue


"Please take a break for as long as you need, and press the mouse button when you are ready to continue."


Phase 2:

"Now we will test you on ALL of the locations by presenting the pictures on the center of the screen and having you drag the picture to the correct location. If you drag the picture to the wrong location, it will pop back to the correct location for a couple of seconds. Use this feedback to learn the actual correct position of each picture. This feedback will continue until you get each location correct once. Click on the mouse to continue"

The correct items have dropped out. We will now test you again on the pictures you have incorrectly placed. Click on the mouse to continue


Test:

We will now test you on the spatial associations you just learned. On each trial, we will place the picture in the center of the screen, and you will use the mouse to drag the picture to the correct location. You will not receive any feedback or corrections for this test. Do you have any questions?
