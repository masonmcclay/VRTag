- to add the new data files to the branch, type "git add VRTag_Sub001_..." (the file name of the subject's data)
- to be sure you will be merging the files you want to merge, type "git status" and check the "new file"

- and finally, merge the new data with the master by typing git merge [branch name] --no-ff
- and push the merged master onto the repository! type "git push"
